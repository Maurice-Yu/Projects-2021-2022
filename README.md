# Projects
# Game Grabber: fall 2021
My first "real program" introduced to fundamental object oriented concepts. Polished my formatting skills and realized the importance of abstraction. It was very satisfying at the end when I could actually use the final product.
# Huffman Code Book: fall 2021
My first implimentation of different data structures, algorithms and big O concepts. Learned how important it is to utilize fast algorithms/data structures
# El Malloc: spring 2022
My first introduction to OS calls and designing data structures revolving around memory allocation/freeing. Developed an appreciation for simple(not simple) built in function calls
# Thermal Updater: spring 2022
My first program written in ASM. Learned how hard it was code back in the day
# Matata: spring 2022
My first introduction to cache aware programing and function abstraction using C. I learned how there are many optimizations beyond big O there were. Function pointers were a tough one to design and impliment. Learned not to use C when possible
# Web Server: fall 2022
My third group project and my first introduction to multithreaded programs. There is so much to keep track of when multithreading. I can understand how there can easily be bugs in webservers.
